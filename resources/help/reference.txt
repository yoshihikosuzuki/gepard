  abstract = {Gepard provides a user-friendly, interactive application for the quick
	creation of dotplots. It utilizes suffix arrays to reduce the time
	complexity of dotplot calculation to Theta(m*log n). A client-server
	mode, which is a novel feature for dotplot creation software, allows
	the user to calculate dotplots and color them by functional annotation
	without any prior downloading of sequence or annotation data. AVAILABILITY:
	Both source codes and executable binaries are available at http://mips.gsf.de/services/analysis/gepard},
